title: "Similarity-Based Product Assortment Optimization"

## Abstract

Optimizing product assortments is a challenging problem. For example, with a limited number of facings for a given CPG product, what products do you put on the shelf? How many facings of each? Existing models call for placing the most popular items on the shelf. In this project, we try and incorporate measures of similarity between products to optimize an assortment that accounts for product diversity.
